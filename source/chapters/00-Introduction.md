## "That town is a red zone": Geographies of the Colombian Armed Conflict in 21^st^-Century Testimonial Narratives

### I. Research Questions

The term "zonas rojas" (red zones), which has pervaded State, media, and cultural discourses since the 1990s, refers to the places in which the Colombian armed conflict has been most prevalent. What is the historical and conceptual background that gives the term "zona roja" its current meaning in Colombian contemporary testimonial narratives? How do these narratives represent the relationship between such "red" spaces and their citizens? How will understanding the pervasiveness and development of the term "zona roja" contribute to the study of the testimonial genre within the Colombian context and beyond? In what ways do Colombian testimonial narratives remap, redefine and reformulate the area of Latin American Testimonial Studies?
